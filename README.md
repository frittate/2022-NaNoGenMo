## A NaNoGenMo entry

### What's going on?

These are several attempts to write Python code which generates a 50 000 word long text document ("novel"). 
The most recent iteration is in the "interior.py" file.

### Results

The results of running the code can be found in documents called INTERIOR-(date).md, which provide a glimpse into earth 5 minutes into the future.

### More about this, here, eventually
