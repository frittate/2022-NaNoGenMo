Maybe you should read A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens. Originally penned in the beautiful language of English. A wonderful part in this books is this, and he started to read:Charles Darnay--just released--congratulating him on his escape from death. Other sound than the owlâs voice there was none, save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then heave a long low sigh, and hold their breath again. Whereas, to this wretched hour I am ignorant of both. Cruncherâs saying grace with particular animosity.  Every eye was turned to the jury. Cruncher could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his liberality--âIâd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.â  The Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton, and said, with more decision, âIt has come to a point.

I think you should read History of Tom Jones, a Foundling by Henry Fielding. It's written in English. Listen to this great part. He began to read:    Chapter viii. âAnd yet, as to that now, how much do you imagine your friend is to have?â--âHow much?â cries Jones, âhow much? Why, at the utmost, perhaps Â£200.â âDo you mean to banter me, young gentleman?â said the father, a little angry. This vice was, however, incurable in him; and though he had often smarted for it, yet if ever he conceived a joke, he was certain to be delivered of it, without the least respect of persons, time, or place. The books which now employed my time solely were those, as well antient as modern, which treat of true philosophy, a word which is by many thought to be the subject only of farce and ridicule.  âI was now reduced to a much higher degree of distress than before: the necessaries of life began to be numbered among my wants; and what made my case still the more grievous was, that my paramour, of whom I was now grown immoderately fond, shared the same distresses with myself.  Mrs Miller then asked what was to be done with Blifil? âfor indeed,â  says she, âI cannot be easy while such a villain is in my house.â--Allworthy answered, âHe was as uneasy as herself on the same account.â âOh!â cries she, âif that be the case, leave the matter to me, I'll soon show him the outside out of my doors, I warrant you.

Another one to consider is The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. Presumably written in English. I especially like this part, and he started to read: After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as well as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where they had more than once spent the winter. The common people who acted with me seemed to me to be godlike. Why inquire too closely into it?  For there would be a real pleasure in watching it.  A new life! That was what he wanted. The audience probably thought it was a duet.  “I am so sorry for you, Alan,” he murmured, “but you leave me no alternative.

I recommend you read The Enchanted April by Elizabeth Von Arnim. Written in English. Listen to this great part. He began to read:  “San Salvatore?” said Mrs. How obviously sensible if each of them had their own special place to sit in apart.  “It seems _so_ wonderful,” she went on in a kind of burst, “and—it is such a miserable day . That was all Mrs.  Also things happened so awkwardly. Fisher, might not be exactly a guest she certainly was not in the very least a hostess, “your room is comfortable.”  “Quite,” said Mrs.

Another one to consider is The Complete Works of William Shakespeare by William Shakespeare. Written in English. Listen to this great part. He began to read:  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.         CLAUDIO.  PERICLES.   SALISBURY. What you have charg’d me with, that have I done; And more, much more; the time will bring it out. He prays you to save his life.
